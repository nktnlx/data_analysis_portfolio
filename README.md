# Aleksandr Nikitin - Data Analysis Portfolio 

## About

Hi, I'm Alex! I have a technical background and hold a Master of Science (M.S.) degree in Geoscience from Saint Petersburg Mining University, with a major in Seismic Data Processing and Analysis. I have 12 years of experience in the field of geoscience, where I held roles such as Data Processing Engineer, Head of Data Processing Department and CTO in a technological startup. After a year of transitioning from geoscience to Data Analysis, I am currently a Data Analyst at a Fintech company. Here is my Data Analyst's career path:
- Sep 2024 --> A/B-testing Platform Lead
- Oct 2023 --> Senior Data Analyst
- May 2022 --> Middle Data Analyst
- Jun 2021 --> Data Analyst
